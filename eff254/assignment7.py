"""Â A note: 
 The instructions for the homework were unclear and contradictory. 
 When ask to define the "insert()" functions, the instructions state that "[[1,2], (3,5), [6,7), (8,10], [12,16]" inserted with "[4,9]" should yield "[[1,2], (3,10], [12,16]]"
 But in the example below, when "[12,13)" is insterted into "[-10,-7], (-4,1], [3,12), [15,24]", it binds into "[-10,-7], (-4,1], [3,13), [15,24]"
 
 So, in one part of the instructions, it is said that we should treat (_,X) join [X,_) as separate, in other, as if we should join them. ([1,2] - (3,10] VS [3,12) - [12,13)
 
 This code joins those intervals into a single one.
