'''
1.use class and functions that we just defined 
2.prompts the user for a list of intervals like ('[-10,-7], (-4,1], [3,6), (8,12), [15,23]')
->so put into merge overlapping list?
3.reads a string from the user: like ('(3,7]')
-> put into insert(merged, newint)
4.display the list at each operation. 
so quit? after that?
